# iTunes Clone

## Overview

This repository contains an iTunes clone project developed to practice implementing PHP and handling user playlists and logins. Although PHP is considered dated and not as widely used as it once was, it remains a valuable tool for understanding server-side logic and its interaction with front-end technologies like JavaScript and HTML.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to create a functional iTunes clone that allowed users to manage their playlists and account details. By using PHP as the primary language, I was able to develop basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities that interact with user data and playlists stored in text files.

## Features

- **UI Design:** The user interface design was inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/ARaut9/itunes_clone).
- **PHP Logic:** Buttons were created to connect with PHP scripts that handle the storage of user data and playlists.
- **CRUD Functions:** 
  - **Create:** Users can create new playlists.
  - **Read:** Playlists can be viewed and accessed by the user.
  - **Update:** Users can add or remove songs from their playlists.
  - **Delete:** Playlists can be deleted as needed.
- **Data Storage:** User information and playlist details are stored in respective `.txt` files.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Primary language used for server-side logic and data handling.
- **JavaScript:** For front-end interactivity.
- **HTML & CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the web pages.

## Acknowledgments
